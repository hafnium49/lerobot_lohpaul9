## Technical Deep Dives

### Residual Action Blending Architecture

The residual RL system uses a novel blending approach:

```python
total_action = base_policy_action + α × residual_rl_action
```

**Benefits:**
- Smooth interpolation between base and learned corrections
- Prevents policy oscillations during training
- Enables graceful degradation if RL fails
- Reduces training time by leveraging base policy knowledge

**Alpha (α) Configuration:**
- `α = 0.0`: Pure base policy (no learning)
- `α = 0.3`: Recommended for GR00T (small corrections)
- `α = 0.5`: Recommended for Jacobian IK (balanced)
- `α = 1.0`: Pure RL (baseline comparison)

### Contact-Gated Reward Shaping

Implemented sophisticated reward function to accelerate learning:

```python
reward = (
    +8.0 × success_bonus              # All corners inside target
    -2.0 × distance_to_goal           # Euclidean distance penalty
    -0.5 × orientation_error          # Keep paper aligned
    +0.8 × reach_bonus                # Approach incentive
    +1.5 × push_reward                # Contact-gated progress
    -0.01 × ||residual||²             # Action smoothness
    -0.5 × robot_table_contact        # Collision avoidance
    -0.005 × time_penalty             # Anti-stalling
)
```

**Contact-Gating Innovation:**
- Push reward only activates when gripper touches paper
- Prevents "air pushing" behaviors
- Accelerates learning of contact-rich manipulation
- Shaped using potential-based rewards (theoretically sound)

### Multi-Rate Control System

Three-tier execution for smooth physics and control:

| Level | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Physics | 360 Hz | MuJoCo simulation timestep |
| Control | 180 Hz | Action interpolation loop |
| Policy | 30 Hz | RL decision-making |

**Benefits:**
- Smooth robot motion (no jerky movements)
- Stable physics simulation
- Efficient policy computation
- Matches real robot control rates
