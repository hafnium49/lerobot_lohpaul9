## 🔑 Key Differences in Official Model

### Joint Specifications
```python
# Official SO-101 joint limits (radians)
shoulder_pan:   [-1.920, 1.920]   # ±110°
shoulder_lift:  [-1.745, 1.745]   # ±100°
elbow_flex:     [-1.690, 1.690]   # ±97°
wrist_flex:     [-1.658, 1.658]   # ±95°
wrist_roll:     [-2.744, 2.841]   # ±160° (asymmetric)
gripper:        [-0.175, 1.745]   # -10° to 100°
```

### Motor Parameters (STS3215)
```python
Force range: [-3.35, 3.35] N⋅m
Damping: 0.60
Friction loss: 0.052
Armature: 0.028
Position kp: 17.8
```

### Visual Appearance
- **Material**: Golden/yellow (rgba: 1.0, 0.82, 0.12, 1.0)
- **Motors**: Dark gray (rgba: 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0)
- **Realistic** proportions and assembly

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Ready to Use!
The system now uses the official SO-101 model by default. All existing scripts work:

```bash
# View the realistic model
python view_world.py

# Train with official model
cd src
python lerobot/scripts/train_so101_residual.py \
  --base-policy jacobian \
  --alpha 0.5 \
  --total-timesteps 500000 \
  --n-envs 4

# Evaluate
python lerobot/scripts/eval_so101_residual.py \
  --model-path ../runs/*/best_model/best_model.zip
```

### Benefits for Training
1. **Realistic Dynamics**: Physics match real robot
2. **Proper Joint Limits**: Won't train infeasible motions
3. **Accurate Forces**: Motor torques realistic
4. **Sim-to-Real**: Policies should transfer better
5. **Visual Fidelity**: Can add cameras later

---

## 🔄 Backwards Compatibility

The old simplified model is kept at `paper_square.xml` if you need it:

```python
# Use old simplified model explicitly
from lerobot.envs.so101_residual_env import SO101ResidualEnv

env = SO101ResidualEnv(
    xml_path="src/lerobot/envs/so101_assets/paper_square.xml"
)
```

But we **strongly recommend** using the official model for all work!

## 📊 Expected Impact on Training

### Physics Accuracy
- ✅ More realistic contact dynamics
- ✅ Proper inertial properties
- ✅ Accurate motor response

### Performance
- Slightly slower (mesh collisions vs primitives)
- Still real-time capable (360 Hz physics, 30 Hz policy)
- No impact on GPU memory (state-only observations)

### Success Rates
- May need to retune Jacobian IK gains
- Pure RL should work the same
- Better sim-to-real transfer expected

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If viewer doesn't show meshes
```bash
# Check mesh files are present
ls src/lerobot/envs/so101_assets/official_model/assets/*.stl
```

### If joints seem stuck
- Official model has realistic joint limits
- Check you're not commanding infeasible positions
- Use `model.jnt_range` to see limits

### If training behaves differently
- Joint limits are tighter than before
- Motor forces are weaker (3.35 vs 20-30 N⋅m)
- This is **correct** - matches real hardware

---

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Calibration Version
- Using `so101_new_calib.xml` (new calibration method)
- Virtual zero at middle of joint range
- More symmetric and intuitive

### Gripper Mechanism
- Single hinge joint (not two slides)
- Range: -0.17 to 1.75 radians (-10° to 100°)
- Coupled fingers (realistic)

### Frame Conventions
- Robot base at (0, -0.35, 0.05) in world
- EE site: `ee_site` at gripper tip
- Base frame: `baseframe` for reference
